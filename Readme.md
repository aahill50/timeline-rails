#Timeline
An application that can be used to chronicle the most important (subjective!) events in your life. You will be able to create "events" which can be labeled, categorized and described exactly the way you want. Eventually, you'll be able to upload pictures that can go along wiht your event. You'll be able to sort and filter your timeline so that you can see it in the exact way that you want!
